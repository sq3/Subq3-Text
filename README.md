#Subq3Text - Solarized and Soda based SublimeText 2 configuration


In the Subq3Text repo are my SublimeText configurations. It uses the [Solarized theme](https://github.com/braver/Solarized) and the [Soda theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme) for SublimeText. 

##Installation
The following will clone the files of this repository to ```~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User```. So you don't need to install Solarized and Soda first.
	
```
$ git clone https://github.com/sq3/subq3-text.git "~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages"
```
